Presentation Skill Evaluation Scoring Mechanism
This document provides a detailed explanation of the scoring mechanism used in the project for evaluating presentation skills from a video.

1. Input:

Video File: The code takes a video file as input, representing the presentation to be evaluated.
2. Core Evaluation Components:

The evaluation focuses on three key aspects of presentation skills:

Eye Contact: Measures the presenter's engagement with the audience by detecting if their eyes are visible and directed towards the camera (or assumed audience).
Hand Movements: Assesses the presenter's use of hand gestures to emphasize points and maintain audience interest.
Audio Clarity: Evaluates the audio signal to determine if the presenter is speaking audibly and consistently.
3. Evaluation Process:

The code processes the video frame by frame, extracting relevant features and assigning scores for each second.

3.1. Video Processing:

MediaPipe: The MediaPipe library is used for:
face_mesh: Detecting facial landmarks, including eye positions.
hands: detecting hand landmarks.
Frame Extraction: The video is read frame by frame using OpenCV (cv2).
RGB Conversion: Each frame is converted to RGB format for MediaPipe processing.

3.2. Eye Contact Scoring:

Landmark Detection: MediaPipe's face_mesh detects facial landmarks.
Visibility Check: A simplified check is performed to determine if the eyes are visible within the detected landmarks.
Note: This is a basic implementation. More advanced eye gaze estimation techniques can be used for improved accuracy.
Score Assignment:
1: If both eyes are deemed visible.
0: If either eye is not visible.
Per-Second Averaging: The eye contact scores for all frames within each second are averaged to produce a single score for that second.

3.3. Hand Movement Scoring:

Landmark Detection: MediaPipe's hands detects hand landmarks.
Hand Detection: If hand landmarks are detected, it indicates hand movement.
Score Assignment:
1: If hand landmarks are detected in the frame.
0: If no hand landmarks are detected.
Per-Second Averaging: The hand movement scores for all frames within each second are averaged.

3.4. Audio Scoring:

Audio Extraction: librosa library is used to extract the audio signal from the video.
RMS Calculation: The Root Mean Square (RMS) of the audio signal is calculated for each short audio segment corresponding to a video frame. RMS represents the average amplitude of the audio signal.
Thresholding: An RMS threshold is used to determine if the presenter is speaking.
If the RMS value is above the threshold, it's assumed the presenter is speaking.
If the RMS value is below the threshold, it's assumed the presenter is silent.
Score Assignment:
1: If the RMS value exceeds the threshold.
0: If the RMS value is below the threshold.
Per-Second Scoring: The audio is evaluated per second, by using the audio data relative to each second.

4. Score Aggregation and Output:

Per-Second Scores: The scores for eye contact, hand movements, and audio are aggregated for each second of the video.
Pandas DataFrame: The scores and corresponding timestamps (in seconds) are stored in a Pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and output.
CSV Output (Optional): The DataFrame can be saved to a CSV file for further processing in other tools.
Average Scores: The average scores for each category (eye contact, hand movements, audio) are calculated and printed.

5. Code Structure and Libraries:

OpenCV (cv2): For video processing.
MediaPipe (mediapipe): For face and hand landmark detection.
NumPy (numpy): For numerical operations.
librosa: for audio analysis.
Pandas (pandas): For data storage and manipulation.
Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot): for plotting the score over time.
Google Colab files: For file uploading and downloading within Colab.
6. Considerations and Potential Improvements:

Eye Gaze Estimation: Implement more advanced eye gaze estimation techniques for accurate eye contact detection.
Facial Expression Analysis: Incorporate facial expression recognition to assess engagement and emotional cues.
Body Posture Analysis: Analyze body posture and movement to evaluate confidence and presence.
Speech Analysis: Add features like speech rate, pauses, and filler word detection.
Speaker Diarization: Separate the speaker's voice from other audio sources.
Adaptive Thresholds: Dynamically adjust thresholds based on video and audio characteristics.
Machine Learning Models: Train machine learning models for more robust and accurate scoring.
Calibration: Allow for calibration to account for variations in lighting, camera quality, and individual differences.
User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for easier video uploading and result visualization.
